# Exploring Data Distribution with Python

This project was developed as part of my Probability and Statistics coursework during my sophomore year. It focuses on analyzing the statistical properties of randomly generated integers using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- Generate 100 random integers between 0 and 80
- Calculate key statistical metrics:
  - Mean, Median, Range
  - Standard Deviation, Variance
  - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
  - Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  - Skewness and Kurtosis
- Visualize the data using:
  - Histogram with mean and median lines
  - Boxplot for distribution overview

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **NumPy**: Data generation and statistical calculations
- **SciPy**: Skewness and kurtosis analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- How to interpret statistical metrics and their significance
- The role of skewness and kurtosis in understanding data shape
- How visualizations enhance data interpretation
- Best practices in combining statistical analysis with clean code and presentation

## ðŸ“· Visual Output

The project includes two key plots:
- A histogram showing the distribution of values with mean and median indicators
- A boxplot highlighting quartiles and potential outliers

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
